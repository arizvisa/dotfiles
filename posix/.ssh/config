# XXX: The "EnableEscapeCommandline" option doesn't exist in older versions of
#      OpenSSH. Yet, for some stupid reason the OpenSSH developers have changed
#      the default vault for this option as disabled despite older versions
#      always having it enabled. Hence, it is impossible to set this option in a
#      way that is compatible with both older and newer versions of the client.
